Design handoff is a critical part of the design process, and it is essential for ensuring that the design is properly implemented by developers. Design handoff should include all of the necessary information about the design including design elements, visual assets, and the color palette. It is important to make sure that everyone involved in the design process is on the same page and understands the design rationale and requirements. To ensure this, the handoff should include a style guide that outlines the design system, typography, color palette, and any other relevant details.

Prior to the handoff, a design review should be conducted to make sure that the design meets all the requirements and any necessary changes are made before the handoff. The handoff should include a detailed explanation of the design, along with any assets needed by the developers, so that they can properly implement the design. An organized and efficient handoff process is key to ensuring that the design is properly implemented and that the project is completed on time and within budget. With a well-structured design handoff process, developers can easily understand the design intent and make sure that the final product meets all the requirements.

### How do you hand over design to developers?

Designer handoff is an essential part of creating a successful product. It ensures that the designs created by the design team are correctly implemented by the development team. To ensure a successful handoff process, it is important to create a design system document that outlines the colors, typography, and components being used in the product. Additionally, it is important to offer developers the design files with clear layers and naming conventions, as well as provide them with a design style guide that outlines the look and feel of the product.

In addition to providing developers with the necessary files and guides, it is important to also develop a clear strategy for when to use existing components and when to create new ones. Providing the developers with detailed specifications, including pixel measurements and font sizes, is also essential. Including screenshots or gifs of the design in action, with annotations to explain the behavior, can also be helpful.

Finally, it is important to set up a system of review and feedback between designers and developers to ensure that the product design is being implemented correctly. Using a handoff tool like Zeplin or InVision to deliver assets and specs is a great way to streamline the handoff process. By following these steps, the design to development process can be smoother and more successful.
